# Projetos Batch

<a href="https://github.com/ItaloPussi/BatchProjects/blob/master/readme.pt.md">VersÃ£o em PortuguÃªs</a> ðŸ‘ˆ

On windows one of the biggest potentials for internal automations is the famous batch files.<br>
In this repository you will find some projects written in batch language. Periodically, I intend to increase it with new subdirectories according to my creativity and as I practice the language.

## Instalation

If you want to test some functionality, just clone the directory, access the chosen subdirectory and start the file ```.bat```

## Disclaimer

Unfortunately windows displays a standard security message when trying to start any .bat file. I cannot remove it but I guarantee that the programs contained here are not malicious.<br>
In addition, batch files only run on devices that have windows installed.
